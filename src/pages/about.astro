        Hi, I’m <a

      <p class="text-justify text-xl tracking-tight mb-2 lg:px-8 lg:py-20">
        Schemamap.io was born out of frustrations of onboarding tenants onto
        Postgres-based systems.<br/> I’ve spent the last 2.5 years building a Swiss
        meat industry ERP system and felt the pain of cleaning customer/tenant
        data and writing scripts to import it.<br/> To meet new requirements, we had
        to grow the system, which involved a lot of manual work patching
        long-running imports to keep them in sync.

        My goal with schemamap.io is to take the above lessons and turn them
        into a turnkey solution that solves this often overlooked but immensely
        painful part of multi-tenant SaaS.
